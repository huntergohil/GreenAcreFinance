Hello, User! 

My name is Hunter Gohil, and I am the tech lead/primary developer of Green Acre Finance! 

Our mission is to provide top tier AI algorithms to the common user, taking back power from big banks! 

Technical details: 
Entire application will eventually be held on AWS (Amazon Web Services)
Databases will be created/managed using dynamoDB
AI will be hosted on EC2 (Likely Spot instance for cost effeciency)
Will likely use Alpaca API to support trading for full launch
